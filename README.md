## What is this?

Serenity is a world class music player which focuses on giving wonderful experience to the user.

## Aspects Involved

### Music

- In the words of Plato

  > Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything.

- In the words of Billy Joel

  > I think music in itself is healing. It’s an explosive expression of humanity. It’s something we are all touched by. No matter what culture we’re from, everyone loves music.

- In the words of Albert Schweitzer
  > There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats.

### Artificial Intelligence

- Machine learning for Facial recognition

### Awesome UI

- > Beauty ain't always a little, cute colored flower. Beauty is anything where people be like, 'Damn.'
- In the words of Yajana
  > When I admire the wonders of an Application or the beauty of the UI, my soul expands in the worship of the creator
