## Aspects Involved

### Music 
- In the words of Plato
	> Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything. 

- In the words of Billy Joel
	> I think music in itself is healing. It’s an explosive expression of humanity. It’s something we are all touched by. No matter what culture we’re from, everyone loves music. 
	
- In the words of Albert Schweitzer
	> There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life: music and cats.

### Artificial Intelligence
- Mechine learning for Facial recognition

### Awesome UI
- > Beauty ain't always a little, cute colored flower. Beauty is anything where people be like, 'Damn.'
- In the words of Yajana  
    > When I admire the wonders of an Application or the beauty of the UI, my soul expands in the worship of the creator
