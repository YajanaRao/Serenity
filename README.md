## What is this ?

Serenity is a audio player which focuses on playing Music, Meditation and Podcasts. It let's you stream audio from various sources including Local and Online storage devices

## Pre-alpha release

The current version is a pre-alpha early access. Some of it is usable, some of it isn't. If there are things that don't work as expected or are counterintuitive, please open an issue so I can prioritize working on them.

## Features

- Listen to audio from local library
- Browsing by genre
- Create playlists and play audio from saved playlists
- Manage audio queue
- Radio mode (automatically queue similar tracks)
- Searching for and playing music from YouTube (including integration with YouTube playlists)
- Voice search songs

## Development Process

Serenity is open to contributions, but I recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let me know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.

Please read [Setup.md](docs/Setup.md) for details on this project.
